# GOING ROGUEâ€”DIY TILES
> * ... And so we made our own library, which for the time being we are simply refering to as "Leaflet.VectorTiles"
> * On the left is a gif showing the prototype view we built, it is pretty long and moves kind of fast, but you can see that the preformance is much better than we would expect, loading 30,000+ features into a canvas layer

## Leaflet.VectorTile
  > In addition to better preformance, L.VectorTiles also includes...

  * Spatial Indexing
  * Methods for Efficient Restyling & fluid retrieval of geometry

  > * enabling us to preform geospatial operations in the browser, style dynamically, and enable editing
  
  * ~424 lines of unminified code
