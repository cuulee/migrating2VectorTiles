# GOING ROGUEâ€”DIY TILES
> * ... And so we made our own plugin, which for the time being we are simply refering to as "Leaflet.VectorTiles"

## Leaflet.VectorTile
  > * Extends L.GridLayer to create canvas (geojson VT)
  > * Includes support for:

  * Spatial Indexing
  * Methods for Efficient Restyling & fluid retrieval of geometry

  > * ... All this in a measly 424 lines of code

  * ~424 lines of unminified code

> * On the left is a gif showing the prototype view we built, it is pretty long and moves kind of fast, but you can see that the preformance is much better than we would expect, loading 30,000+ features into a canvas layer
