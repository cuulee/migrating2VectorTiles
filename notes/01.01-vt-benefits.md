# WHY ALL THE EXCITEMENT?
> So why are we seening so many people interested in using VT?

### 1. Shiny new tech!
  > for one, new software developed around vector Tiles can do a lot of awesome things such as:
    * Floating point zoom levels
    * on-the-fly simplification
    * 3D rendering

### 2. Short-comings of traditional data formats
  > In addition to giving us all these great new techniques for visualizing geographic data, VT solve some really fundamental problems that have plagued web mappers for a long, long time.
  * Specifiacally, I am thinking of the tradeoff that we have had to navigate between interactivity and performance
