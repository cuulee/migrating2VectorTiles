> So why are we seening so many people interested in using VT?

### 1. Shiny new tech!
  > for one, from a purely visual, forward-facing perspective, VT can do a lot of awesome things, in particuar I'm thinking of the MapboxGL and the super amazing things it can to, such as:
  * Floating point zoom levels
  * on-the-fly simplification
  * 3D rendering

### 2. Short-comings of traditional data formats
  > * In addition to giving us all these great new techniques for visualizing geographic data, VT solve some really fundamental problems that have plagued web mappers for a long, long time.
    * Specifiacally, I am thinking of the tradeoff that we have had to navigate between interactivity and performance
