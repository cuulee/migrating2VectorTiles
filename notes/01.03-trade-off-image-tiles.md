> Option 1 for displaying data on a map is image tiles

## Image Tiles
  > * Take our information and render it as images on our server and stream it back to the client as PNGs
  > * Subdivide the world into grid of 256x256 px cells for zoom levels 1-18
  > * Only load visible tiles and replace them as the zoom level and bounding box changes

## Efficiency
  > * **Skip data that isn’t visible**
  > * Caps the size of data because images are already rendered

## Interactivity
  > * **Flexibility**
    - Tiles are prerendered on a server
    - Can’t make changes without completely redrawing the image and updating the cache
  > * **Intelligence** - Cannot interact with the data via the tile
