## Goals
  > * So, as part of this strategizing, the first thing we did was to lay out our goals for this whole effort.
  > * **Why are we doing this? / What do we need to come out of this process with?**
  > * I think this was a useful excersize because it kept us honest and served as a **rubric** while we were evaluating our options.
  > * ... and what we decided was...

### 1. Enhance performance as we prepare to scale up
  > * We wanted to prepare for the growing needs of our clients.
  > * ... Never wanted there to be a day, where our product couldn't handle a clients network because of the size of their data

### 2. Minimize switching costs and reengineering (as much as possible)
  > * We needed to be efficient in the way that we addressed this problem

### 3. Maintain Interactivity
  > * We couldn't sacrifice any functionality -- at all
  > * Can be difficult when each piece of technology has its own limitations
  > * Specifically, we sneed to support:

####  - Dynamic Restyling
####  - GIS Functions (Point in polygon, nearest features)
####  - Editings
