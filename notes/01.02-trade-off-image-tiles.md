* Subdivide the world into grid of 256x256 px cells for zoom levels 1-18
* Only load visible tiles and replace them as the zoom level and bounding box changes

## Efficiency
* Skip data that isn’t visible
* Caps the size of data because images are already rendered

## Interactivity
* **Intelligence** - Cannot interact with the data via the tile
* **Flexibility** - Can’t make changes without completely redrawing the image and updating the cache
