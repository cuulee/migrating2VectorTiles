# Weighing our options...
> After setting our goals, we analyzed our options.
> What tools could we potentially use?
  * Right off the bat, we knew that this would mean updating our stack because Leaflet doesn't natively support vector tiles.
  * And while there are now serveral excellent Leaflet plugins for rendering VT, none did what we needed
  * So this left us with 2 options...

### A. UPDATE OUR MAP CODE TO USE ANOTHER LIBRARY
> * ... We could stop using Leaflet all together and move to something else

### B. EXTEND A PLUGIN TO MEET OUR NEEDS
> * We could contribute one of these plugins and supplement it with the functionality we needed


> * Considering the scale of a complete replacement effort...
  - we are employing approx. 10 plugins already that would all need to be replaced
  - ... decided that option A would contradict our goal of efficiency
