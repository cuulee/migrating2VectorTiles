# Weighing our options...
> After looking at our goals, we laid out our options.
> What tools could we potentially use?
  * Right off the bat, this proved challenging because Leaflet doesn't natively support vector tiles, so we were definitely going to have to bring another piece of software into the mix.
  * And while there are now serveral excellent Leaflet plugins for rendering VT, none did what we needed
  * So this left us with 2 options...

### 1. EXTEND A PLUGIN TO MEET OUR NEEDS
> * We could contribute one of these plugins and supplement it with the functionality we needed

### 2. UPDATE OUR MAP CODE TO USE ANOTHER LIBRARY
> * ... We could stop using Leaflet all together and move to something else
> * This would be a giant effort, and one that we inevitably decided we couldn't justify until we had exausted our other options
