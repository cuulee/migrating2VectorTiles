# Weighing our options...
> After looking at our goals, we laid out our options.
> What tools could we potentially use?
  * Right off the bat, this proved challenging because Leaflet doesn't natively support vector tiles, so we were definitely going to have to bring another piece of software into the mix.
  * And while there are now serveral excellent Leaflet plugins for rendering VT, none did what we needed
  * So this left us with 2 options...

### 1. EXTEND A PLUGIN TO MEET OUR NEEDS
> * We could contribute one of these plugins and supplement it with the functionality we needed

### 2. UPDATE OUR MAP CODE TO USE ANOTHER LIBRARY
> * ... We could stop using Leaflet all together and move to something else
> * This would be a giant effort, and one that we inevitably decided we couldn't justify until we had exausted our other options

> * So we set out attempting to add editing functionality to an existing plugin and were fairly successful
>   - But at the end of the day, it became clear that the functionality that we were adding to the repo, wasn't really going to stand to serve any other parts of the lib
>   - ...and we were really only leveraging the code that we were adding, which was a tiny sliver of the codebase
>   - and so to avoid a whole lot of maintainence issues Kelvin, our intern who did the heavy lifting on this project, made a bold suggestion...
>   - let's just make our own library...
