# What worked
_What were the benefits to us going out on a limb and create this library?_
* Interactivity - _Well for one, this solution allowed us to maintain all the functionality that we needed._

* Low Maintainence Costs - _because this is a simple, straight forward_

* Low Switching Costs
  - _=> it also kept our maintainence and switching costs low, because it is so simple and straight forward. Having been built using Leaflet API, there aren't too many new functions we need to impliment _
