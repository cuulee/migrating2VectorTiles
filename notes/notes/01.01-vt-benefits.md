_So why are we seening so many people interested in using VT?_

1. Shiny new tech!
  _for one, from a purely visual, forward-facing perspective, VT can do a lot of awesome things, in particuar I'm thinking of the MapboxGL and the super amazing things it can to {Something about how it is run on the graphics card instead of memory}_
  * Floating point zoom levels
  * on-the-fly simplification
  * 3D rendering

2. Short-comings of traditional data formats
  _In addition to giving us all these great new techniques for visualizing geographic data, VT solve some really fundamental problems that that have plagued web mappers for a long long time._
  _Specifiacally, I am thinking of the tradeoff that we have had to navigate between interactivity and performance_
  _When our datasets our large, we have had to make a choice about which of these features are more important_
