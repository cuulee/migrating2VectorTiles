Send the vector data to the browser, where it is rendered on the fly.
  * When the user zooms or pans, the vector data is **repositioned on top**
  * Decouple the data from the mapped representation

## Interactivity
* **Flexibility** - Because the process of rendering the data is done on the client, we can easily make updates to the data or style
* **Intelligence** -  We can bind what ever data we need to, directly to the map element, and use that data to preform spatial operations

## Efficiency
  * ... however because the style and the rendering are separate -- the more data we need to render the bigger the burden on the browser, which means we need to be vigelent of how the dataset itself will impact UX.
