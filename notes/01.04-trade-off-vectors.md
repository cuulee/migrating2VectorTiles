# Vector Format
> So, because image tiles don't let us have any fun, we have long used option #2 for interactive layers.

> Send the vector data to the browser, where it is rendered on the fly using a library like d3 or leaflet to create DOM elements that corespond with our map data.
  * The DOM elements are situated over the map and when the user zooms or pans, this vector data is **repositioned on top**

## Interactivity
> * **Flexibility** - Because the process of rendering the data is done on the client, we can easily make updates to the data or style
> * **Intelligence** -  We can bind what ever data we need to, directly to the map element, and use that data to preform spatial operations

## Efficiency
> * Because we are rendering each data point as a different DOM elemnent, as our dataset gets large it can become quite purden on the browser.
  * This burden is exasterbated because in a traditional geojson implementation, the server is completely unaware of what subset of the dataset is currently visible.  So if your looking on a a dataset like this

  > * ...you could actually be loading/rendering this
