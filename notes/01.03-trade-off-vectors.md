* Unlike image tiles we **work with the entire dataset directly**
* When the user zooms or pans, the vector data is **repositioned on top**

---

* ~~Because of the limitations of mapping exclusively with tile layers, as computers got faster and web mapping tools got more sophisticated, we wanted more interaction with the data and we adopted a strategy of sandwiching layers of a map~~

* If you are using this type and are concerned with preformance, note that SVG is more efficient than Div and canvas is more efficient than SVG
