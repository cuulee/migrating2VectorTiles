# CONCLUSIONS

### 1. Migration is hard, but vector tiles are worth it
> * Yes updating your tech stack is an challenging process, but if you are struggling with the limitations of traditional data formats, the investment will (hopefully) be worth it.
> * Migration doesn't have to be a gut job, it can be a gradual transition

### 2. Lots of great software out there
> * The point of this presentation was by no means to get up here and tell you that you need to write a plugin in order to use VT in leaflet or that you should use some other piece of software, you should pick the approach that will best serve your project's needs

### 3. Stategize based on the issues your project is currently experiencing and your goals for the future
> * Define goals, inventory affected features, analyze your options
> * Know what you need and what your getting before you start and only take on the amount of work that makes sense
